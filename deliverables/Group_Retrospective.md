# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* From the beginning I think we were able to determine appropriate roles for each group member based on past experience.
* We were all able to learn Unity and make very good progress on our game despite most of us having little experience with Unity.
* Our team really worked well together from the get-go. There were no disputes or mistunderstandings amongst us in the entirety of the project.

## What could have been better in the group...
* It was tough finding meeting times that worked for everyone due to class/work schedules everyone had.
* Segregation of work amongst the members was not optimal. The work could have divided more efficiently.
* We should have had more strict deadlines for ourselves.

## What went well in the class...
* The guest lectures were very insightful in many different areas of software engineering that I had never considered before.
* Having some Thursday meeting times was very nice for weeks where everyone's schedule did not line up. So even though some of us couldn't make it to a particular week's discord meeting, we could make the Thursday class meeting.
* We had real life learning of how software projects work with all of the hurdles and learnings of working with a team and setting our own deadlines.

## What could have been better in the class...
* I totally understant that this was out of his control, but I believe it's worth mentioning; Cogan's schedule this semester forced us to move certain dates around in the course schedule.
* It would have been better if we had more time to work on the actual project. After having to work on all of the documents, we only had limited time left to work on the actual software which made things harder for us towards the end of the semester.

## Further Comments
* Nothing that hasn't already been mentioned.
