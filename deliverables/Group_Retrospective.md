# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* From the beginning I think we were able to determine appropriate roles for each group member based on past experience.
* We were all able to learn Unity and make very good progress on our game despite most of us having little experience with Unity.

## What could have been better in the group...
* It was tough finding meeting times that worked for everyone due to class/work schedules everyone had.

## What went well in the class...
* The guest lectures were very insightful in many different areas of software engineering that I had never considered before.
* Having some Thursday meeting times was very nice for weeks where everyone's schedule did not line up. So even though some of us couldn't make it to a particular week's discord meeting, we could make the Thursday class meeting.

## What could have been better in the class...
* I totally understant that this was out of his control, but I believe it's worth mentioning; Cogan's schedule this semester forced us to move certain dates around in the course schedule. 

## Further Comments
* Nothing that hasn't already been mentioned.
