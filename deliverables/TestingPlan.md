# Testing

## Testing Plan
  - The testing of Raider Parkour will be carried out by Dipesh Paneru (Me) being the graduate student of the group.
  - Testing will be done on one feature at a time refrenced by a requirement. As soon as a feature, pointed by the requirement document, is completed, it is kept on a pipeline of features to be tested. The tester Dipesh will then take one feature at a time from the pipeline and test it according to the framework that suits it best.
  - If the feature passes the test it is considered to be done, otherwise the feature is then added to its original developers bugs list.
  - This process is done as many times as necessary until it is completely bug free in order for any feature to be considered complete.

    
## Testing Framework
  - Following Frameworks will be used in testing

    ### Unit Testing
    - The logical portion of the game is written in code and it needs to be tested throughly. I will be using Unit Tests inorder to test the individual units or blocks of code.

    ### Functional Testing
    - As our software system is a game we will be using Functional Testing in order to test the actual functionality of the test. The best way to test a game is to play it and functional testing entails the same.
