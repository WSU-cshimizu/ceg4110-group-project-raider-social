* How does rapid prototyping work?
  - Since customers want products faster (they have more money than time), they aim to get a minimum viable product or a prototype ready for use within 2 weeks. They start by meeting with a user. A few days later, they have a 3-day workshop, preferably with users conveying what is valuable. Through this they get a vision for the product that they use to develop in about 5 days. When development starts, they get a roadmap for the week and treat everyday as a sprint.
