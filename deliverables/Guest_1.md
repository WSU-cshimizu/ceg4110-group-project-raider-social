## Pertinent Questions
* Is communication on all type of platforms or one specifically?
  - Microsoft Teams very extensively. A lot of work is remote for meetings.
* Are there other factors for prioritizing work?
  - Other companies that have a long time relationship with the company would be taken care of to keep the relationship strong.

## Lessons Learned
Dayton Frieght organizes work with backlog which contains a priority order of large projects, small items, and prioritizing bugs/tickets based on how it impacts work. Organizes work with heavy communication with its stakeholders and developer teams.  On average 4-5 hrs a day talking with teams.
