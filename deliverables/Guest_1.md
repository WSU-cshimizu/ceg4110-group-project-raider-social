## Pertinent Questions
* Is communication on all type of platforms or one specifically?
  - Microsoft Teams very extensively. A lot of work is remote for meetings.
* Are there other factors for prioritizing work?
  - Other companies that have a long time relationship with them would be taken care of to keep the relationship strong.

## Lessons Learned
Dayton Frieght organizes work with backlog which contains a priority order of large projects, small items, and prioritizing bugs/tickets based on how it impacts work. Organizes work with heavy communication with its stakeholders and developer teams.  On average 4-5 hrs a day talking with teams.

Communication is more than just discussions between team members. It is important for everyone to be present either via in person or over their camera. Visually seeing everyones faces can help get a better understanding if team members are confused or interested in the topic at hand. If a team can get everyone on the same page and interested with the project or issue at hand, it can boost productivity and morale. Daily "stand up" with the development team can help update team on what's going on with everyone so everything is more organized.

Scrum Vs Kanban in the agile space:
 Scrum is a 2 week "sprint" cycle and a very tough service industry, kanban is a system that keeps work moving along and limits the amount of items open and not forgotten.

DFLâ€™s user story rule is that they should be made in a way that developers can finish them and push them to production right away. They can typically be stand-alone or part of a larger project.

## Difference Between Lecture and Speaker
In class we did our user story on the whole project but at Dayton Frieght they break the user stories into smaller individual parts.
