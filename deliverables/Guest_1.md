## Pertinent Questions
* Is communication on all type of platforms or one specifically?
  - Microsoft Teams very extensively. A lot of work is remote for meetings.
* Are there other factors for prioritizing work?
  - Other companies that have a long time relationship with them would be taken care of to keep the relationship strong.

## Lessons Learned
Dayton Frieght organizes work with backlog which contains a priority order of large projects, small items, and prioritizing bugs/tickets based on how it impacts work. Organizes work with heavy communication with its stakeholders and developer teams.  On average 4-5 hrs a day talking with teams.

Communication is more than just discussions between team members. It is important for everyone to be present either via in person or over their camera. Visually seeing everyones faces can help get a better understanding if team members are confused or interested in the topic at hand. If a team can get everyone on the same page and interested with the project or issue at hand, it can boost productivity and morale.
