# Name of Project - Raider Parkour


## Elevator Pitch
- Raider Parkour will be a 3D parkour game that involves a user controlling a character jumping across challenging platforms to reach the ultimate finish line. 

## N things of complexity (components)

- UI Design
  - Creating a Interface that is both appealing to look at and easy to use for the end user. We will be using Unity to develop a parkour map with various styles of platforms and map designs. 

- Backend
  - We will create a Server for our Frontend to communicate with. The Server will query the Database to fetch all the data that is required for our users to interact with the system.  

- Data Storage
  - We will setup a Database using PostgreSQL to persistently store all of the data that our system utilizes, including the user data and other system data as well.

- Deployment
  - The server will be hosted on the Internet so that any user with the access to the Internet can have access to our system. We will be using a hosting service such as GoDaddy to host our server.

- Testing
  - The whole system is going to be thoroughly tested for its functionality, implementation and to reduce the amount of Bugs so that our Raiders can have a smooth and bug free experience whist using our application.
  
## What language or technology stack or framework will be used (Why as well)?



## How do the components fit together (i.e., predicted architecture)?



## What is the predicted life cycle/methodology that you will follow

  We will be working according to Agile Methodology because it will allow us to break up the project in multiple phases and ensure that we will be able to deliver at least the Minimal Viable Product in the given constrained time frame.

  Scrum:
  We will specifically be following Scrum framework in this project. We are planning on making the Sprints two weeks long.
