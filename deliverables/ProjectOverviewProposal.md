# Name of Project - Raider Parkour


## Elevator Pitch
- Raider Parkour will be a 3D parkour game that involves a user controlling a character jumping across challenging platforms to reach the ultimate finish line. 

## N things of complexity (components)

- UI Design
  - Creating an interface that is both visually appealing and easy to use, balancing simplicity and functionality to ensure a smooth user experience. 

- Backend
  - We will manage game logic and player data ensuring smooth and efficient gameplay while preventing bad interactions with the enviroment (clipping through walls, etc).

- Data Storage
  - We will use an addon in Unity to store amd manage the game data to persistently store correct local user data.

- 3D Design
  - We will use Blender to create visually pleasing and performance-optimized 3D models and environments for the game, ensuring that it runs smoothly and that the objects feel natural rather than jarring or disjointed.

- Testing
  - The game will be thoroughly tested for its functionality and implementation to reduce the number of bugs, ensuring that our Raiders have a smooth and bug-free experience while playing our game.
  
## What language or technology stack or framework will be used (Why as well)?
- Unity: We will be using the Unity engine as the "backbone" of our game. The majority of the game will be developed and tested within Unity as it provides all the necessary tools to do so.
  
- C#: We will use C# as out primary language as it is Unity's default language. C# scripts in Unity will allow us to develop every part of our game with more granular control if necessary.
  
- Blender: We will use the 3D modeling application Blender, to create any custom assets because it is free/open source and offers extensive modeling tools, allowing us to achieve the results we need.

## How do the components fit together (i.e., predicted architecture)?
- Using the tools of Unity and its engine, the architecture of this project should be able to talk to itself without having to reach out to 3rd party software. Many Unity components work flawlessly together to make our jobs much more easier than relying on 3rd parties to be "compatible" with our app. 

- UI DESIGN + BACKEND + DEPLOYMENT + TESTING + DATA STORAGE   =  Project Success :) 
 


## What is the predicted life cycle/methodology that you will follow

  We will be working according to Agile Methodology because it will allow us to break up the project in multiple phases and ensure that we will be able to deliver at least the Minimal Viable Product in the given constrained time frame.

  Scrum:
  We will specifically be following Scrum framework in this project. We are planning on making the Sprints two weeks long.
