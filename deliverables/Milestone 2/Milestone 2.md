# Milestone 2
* Main lobby has been created as well as some of the first course. First Person Controller is a good basis for the camera/character object in that all major functions are built-in including momentum. Though movement is somewhat difficult, which actually adds to the skill required to complete the course.
* Main Menu was created for the whole course itself. It is operated by 2 buttons that are coded to start and quit application. Appearance includes a green background with title and buttons with names.
