# Requirements Specification

## Tyler Wells
### User Story Developer
- As a developer I want to develop the in-game toggle events(i.e score, start menu) to help ensure a straight and fun direction for a player to achieve goals and rewards so that they are obligated to be more 'engaged'.

1.1 Implement Toggle Functionality of Score Display.
   -  The game will provide a toggle feature that allows a player show and hide their score during gameplay. This feature will be provided as a hotkey option at the users disposal.

1.2. Implement a Start Menu with Interactive Options
   - The game will have a start menu on load up that allows a player to choose between options to start or quit game. It will be very easy to navigate and look appealing to the user.
