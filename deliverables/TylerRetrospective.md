# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* I think off the start we were able to click and form a good group with good intentions for our project. 
* When there was a problem we were able to fix or discuss it in our group chat pretty quickly with no objections. 

## What could have been better in the group...
* We could not meet as much as we would like with everyones schedules being a bit separate, but we were able to talk regularly through group chats.

## What went well in the class...
* It was interesting seeing the many different guest lectures and what they brought to the field. 
* It was nice being able to see my classmates twice a week when everyones schedules did not line up outside of that. It gave us time to reflect what we have done in our projects and talk to proffesor.

## What could have been better in the class...
* I wish there was more time on Tuesdays to go over project. I also wish there was some better organization of how the project is supposed to be presented to the class via github.
