## Pertinent Questions
* Advantages of small companies vs large companies and vice versa.
   - Smaller companies have very tight knit teams, so everyone is very approachable. Large companies are well established so job security is better.


## Lessons Learned
* Software engineering is about engineering correct software, not just writing code.

* No company is the same and they will all operate differently. Even specific teams within a company will likely implement paradigms differently.
 
* Job hopping is not a bad thing early on in one’s career.
