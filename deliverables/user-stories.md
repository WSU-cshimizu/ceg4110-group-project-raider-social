# User Story Compendium

## Immanuel Sabwami
### Developer
As a developer, I want to implement various custom-made 3d assets for the game to give it more character and to separate from any other similar projects built using our workflow, which would prevent our game from looking like every other generic parkour game showcased in many of the tutorials available across the internet.

### User
As a player, I want to be able to use momentum mechanics to improve the “realism” of character movement, which could make some obstacles easier to traverse the faster I move through them, adding an extra layer of skill required to quickly traverse the course. 

## Dipesh Paneru (Graduate Student)

### Developer
As a Developer, I want to implement various movement mechanism such as moving forward and jumping, which will allow the player of the game to actually traverse the 3d space available in the game.

### User
As a Player, I want to be able to see a High-score board to keep track of my previous achievements in the game, so that I can challenge myself to get better the following iteration. 

### Test
As a Tester, I want to be able to play the game without being "Killed" (i.e game restarting) in any case, so that I can focus on the actual testing of the game instead of being focused on not being killed so that the game does not restart.

## Hayden Troxell
### Developer
As a developer, I want to develop the backend logic that will insure smooth collision detection, which will allow the player to enjoy the game and its enviorment without having any player model clipping issuses.

### User
As a player, I want to be able to use the basic game controls to traverse the world and try to beat my High-score while also not running into any bugs that will decrease my in-game immersion.

## Tyler Wells
### Developer
As a developer I want to develop the in-game toggle events(i.e score, start menu) to help ensure a straight and fun direction for a player to achieve goals and rewards so that they are obligated to be more 'engaged'. 

### User
As a player, I want to be able to play the game with smooth representation of a competitive aspect so that I can beat other peoples high scores and enjoy the moment.
