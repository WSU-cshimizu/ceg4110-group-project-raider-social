# User Story Compendium

## Immanuel Sabwami
### Developer
As a developer, I want to implement various custom-made 3d assets for the game to give it more character and to separate from any other similar projects built using our workflow, which would prevent our game from looking like every other generic parkour game showcased in many of the tutorials available across the internet.

### User
As a player, I want to be able to use momentum mechanics to improve the “realism” of character movement, which could make some obstacles easier to traverse the faster I move through them, adding an extra layer of skill required to quickly traverse the course. 

## Details
This document will compile a collection of user stories that have the perspective of the end-user, as well as the perspective of fellow developers. These user stories should conform to the format specified in the `./learning` directory.
