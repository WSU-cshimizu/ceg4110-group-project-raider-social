    - Scrum for longer projects and Kanban for others  

* How are time zones handled?
    - Most scrum meetings are between 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM. The benefit of the time zone difference is that they also get upwards of 20 hrs of development time a day.

## Lessons Learned
* Win supply prefers to develop software in-house. They have done drone deliveries, built smart lockers, and worked on RFID warehousing.

* WinSupply is currently managing upwards of 200 different dev projects. A lot of their projects have year to year-and-half road maps.
