## Pertinent Questions
* What agile frameworks does WinSupply use?
    - Scrum for longer projects and Kanban for others  

* How are time zones handled?
    - Most scrum meetings are between 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM. The benefit of the time zone difference is that they also get upwards of 20 hrs of development time a day.
 
* How well does AI fit in into the workplace? How useful is it before it becomes a hinderance and/or devs are relying too heavily on it?

## Lessons Learned
* Win supply prefers to develop software in-house. They have done drone deliveries, built smart lockers, and worked on RFID warehousing.

* WinSupply is currently managing upwards of 200 different dev projects. A lot of their projects have year to year-and-half road maps.

* Technology is like a pendulum. Like how it tips one way for a time period, then trends shift to the opposite after cons become more prominent. such as outsourcing, virtulization, cloud first, mobile apps, metaverse, and AI.

## Difference Between Lecture and Speaker
* Chris specifically mentioned pitfalls of agile including lack of communication and Lack of planning before development.
